# Quantum Integer Programming (QIP)

## Overview

This repository focuses on **Quantum Integer Programming (QIP)**, an advanced topic at the intersection of quantum computing and optimization. The projects and code in this repository explore the formulation and solution of integer programming problems using quantum computing techniques. The primary objective is to leverage quantum algorithms to tackle complex combinatorial optimization problems more efficiently than classical methods.

## Key Topics and Projects

### 1. **Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) Formulation**
- **Description:** This project involves formulating the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and GAMA formulations. The SVP is a fundamental problem in lattice-based cryptography and plays a critical role in quantum-resistant encryption techniques.

### 2. **Quantum Knapsack Problem**
- **Description:** A quantum approach to solving the knapsack problem, which involves selecting items with given weights and values to maximize the total value without exceeding a weight limit. The solution leverages quantum annealing and postprocessing techniques to optimize the QUBO formulation.

### 3. **Graver Basis Computation**
- **Description:** Implementation of Graver basis computation for solving integer programming problems. This method iteratively enhances the objective function while ensuring that constraints are satisfied, providing a powerful tool for optimization in high-dimensional spaces.

### 4. **Groebner Basis Calculations**
- **Description:** Utilizes Groebner bases for solving polynomial ideals in optimization problems. The project explores their application in simplifying and solving complex problems, including those in lattice-based cryptography.
